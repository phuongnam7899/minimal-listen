Title: How I Manage Projects

Planning

- Define outcomes and metrics; break into milestones and epics; estimate with ranges.
- Identify risks/dependencies; create spikes; write ADRs for key decisions.

Execution

- Scrum/Kanban; trunk-based dev; WIP limits; daily async updates; biweekly demos.
- Definition of Ready/Done; acceptance criteria; test strategy; release plan.

Quality & delivery

- CI gates (lint/test/scan); CD with progressive rollouts; observability and SLOs.

Stakeholders

- Weekly status, roadmap updates, risk register, change logs; clear RACI; customer feedback loops.
